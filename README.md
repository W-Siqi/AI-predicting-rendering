# AI-predicting-rendering
This is a tech demo, showing how we use marchine learning to generate **environment map** from a 2D backgound picture. Then we use this **evniroment map** to do the lighting calculation for the 3D model in the scene.   
## ongoing plan

# Examples
example illustrasion
1. result picture: 
2. enviroment map: 
## indoor examples

## outdoor examples

# Application scenario & Problems we solve  
1. AR/MR: real-time requirement 
2. Flim:  
3. Advertising:


# Pipeline walkthrough 
## The part this repo cover?
## Why need mechine learning?
## Why we distinguish indoor and outdoor cases?
